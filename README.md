# REDUX:===== STEPS::-----------
- Redux is not a part of react. it is a external library that we need to install
- npm install @reduxjs/toolkit
- npm install react-redux
- we will create the store
- connect the new store to our applicatio(APP.JS) by using (ACTION-DISPATCH-REDUCER METHOD)
- will create the slice component like (cart,profile)
- subscribing to slice/store by using (selectors)
